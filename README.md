# Matrix_Operation_Playground
A Python-based project that provides a Matrix Operations Playground â€” a CLI tool to perform and experiment with fundamental matrix operations. Built with Python and NumPy, the program includes robust exception handling to gracefully manage invalid inputs, singular matrices, and dimension mismatches.

# Features
Implemented in Python with NumPy library 
Exception Handling for edge cases

Supports the following operations: 
Addition 
Subtraction 
Multiplication 
Transpose 
Inverse 
Determinant

# Next Steps:
Add support for eigenvalues and eigenvectors 
Improve CLI formatting for large matrices 
Provide visualization examples using matplotlib

Matrix Playground is designed as both an educational tool and a practical utility for students, learners, and developers who want to experiment with linear algebra concepts directly in Python.
